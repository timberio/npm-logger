**New to Timber?** [Here's a low-down on logging in Javascript.](https://github.com/timberio/timber-js)

## `@timberio/js`

This NPM library contains the following two packages:

### [@timberio/browser](https://github.com/timberio/timber-js/tree/master/packages/browser)

### [@timberio/node](https://github.com/timberio/timber-js/tree/master/packages/node)

It's provided for convenience, as an alternative to installing multiple packages for universal / isomorphic apps.

## Usage

Here's how to get started:

### Any Node.js environment (including Webpack/Rollup)

First, install the package via NPM:

```
npm i @timberio/js
```

In ES6/Typescript, you can then import either the `Browser` or `Node` class as required for your environment:

```typescript
import { Browser, Node } from "@timberio/js";

// `Browser` is equivalent to the `Timber` class exported by @timberio/browser
const clientLogger = new Browser(
  "timber-organization-key",
  "timber-source-key"
);

// And the same with `Node` and @timberio/node
const serverLogger = new Node("timber-organization-key", "timber-source-key");
```

For CommonJS, require the package instead:

```js
const { Browser, Node } = require("@timberio/js");
```

## Logging

Both the Node.js and browser logging classes provide a `.log()` function for logging to [Timber.io](https://timber.io)

See the readme for the [Node.js](https://github.com/timberio/timber-js/tree/master/packages/node) and [browser](https://github.com/timberio/timber-js/tree/master/packages/browser) logging for the full API.

## FAQ

**Why install this instead of each package separately?**

`@timberio/js` combines the latest `@timberio/browser` and `@timberio/node` packages.

This is useful for apps that contain both Node.js (server) and browser (client) logging. It makes your `package.json` a bit cleaner to maintain just one package, instead of two.

**Why are there different classes for the browser and Node?**

The [browser](https://github.com/timberio/timber-js/tree/master/packages/browser) and [Node.js](https://github.com/timberio/timber-js/tree/master/packages/node) APIs both have a `.log()` method and both extend the [core JS logger](https://github.com/timberio/timber-js/tree/master/packages/core).

But, each have their own optimizations for how they sync logs with Timber.io, and extra methods to take advantage of unique Node.js and browser features not available in the other environment.
